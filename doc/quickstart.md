# Quickstart #

The easiest way is to use the `Makefile` in this repository: [parosol_example](https://github.com/reox/parosol_example).


Or you can also run the examples in this repository.

We consider that the `parosol` and `createxmf` executable is in `$PATH`.

Extract the examples using:

    tar xjvf mesh.tar.bz2

The following command starts the simulation:

    mpirun -np 4 parosol --level 3 --tol 1e-7 mesh/h5/sphere.h5

ParOSol is started with four processes. This is suited for a computer with
four cores.
It is recommended to use only the number of physical cores for the simulation.
You can query the number of physical cores using the command `lscpu`.

At most three level are used in the multigrid preconditioner and
the solving tolerance is set to 1eâ€“7. For large input mesh more levels
should be used. The results is written back into the original mesh.

To visualize the results in Paraview, we need to create a XDMF file, containing
the description of the data in the HDF5 file.
To do so, use the `createxmf` tool:

    createxmf mesh/h5/sphere.h5

Now open up Paraview and open `mesh/h5/sphere.xmf`.
